# Cat and Dog Image Classifier

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs using TensorFlow/Keras. The goal is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify images as either a cat or a dog. The project uses a dataset of labeled cat and dog images, and involves data augmentation, model training, evaluation, and performance visualization.

## Overview

In this project, the model is trained to classify images of cats and dogs using the **Cats and Dogs dataset**. The images are preprocessed using techniques like rescaling, data augmentation, and normalization. The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets, and the model is built using a series of convolutional layers, followed by fully connected layers. After training, the model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy and loss.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains images of cats and dogs and is structured as follows:

- **train/**: Contains subfolders `cats/` and `dogs/` with images for training.
- **validation/**: Contains subfolders `cats/` and `dogs/` with images for validation.
- **test/**: Contains images for testing (without labels).

You can download the dataset from FreeCodeCamp's [GitHub repository](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-cat-and-dog-image-classifier).

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The programming language used for the project.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: Deep learning framework used for model building and training.
- **Matplotlib**: Used for plotting training and validation accuracy and loss graphs.
- **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations.

## Setup Instructions

To run this project locally or in a cloud environment like Google Colab, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier.git
   cd Cat-and-Dog-Image-Classifier
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   
   Ensure that you have the required libraries. You can use `pip` to install them:

   ```bash
   pip install tensorflow matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. Download the dataset:
   
   If you're using Google Colab, run the following code to download the dataset:

   ```python
   !wget https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/project-data/cats-and-dogs/cats_and_dogs.zip
   !unzip cats_and_dogs.zip
   ```

4. Set up paths and directories:

   ```python
   PATH = 'cats_and_dogs'
   train_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'train')
   validation_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'validation')
   test_dir = os.path.join(PATH, 'test')
   ```

5. Run the notebook:

   Open and run the `cat_dog_classifier.ipynb` notebook to train and evaluate the model.

## Usage

1. **Train the model**: The model is trained using the training data and evaluated using the validation data.

2. **Make predictions**: After training, you can use the trained model to predict whether an image is of a cat or a dog.

3. **Model Evaluation**: The model's performance is evaluated based on the accuracy and loss on the training and validation datasets. The training process is visualized using `matplotlib` to plot accuracy and loss curves.

## Model Evaluation

After training the model, you can evaluate its performance on the test set and visualize the accuracy and loss during the training process.

```python
# Plot training and validation accuracy/loss
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))
plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
plt.plot(epochs_range, acc, label='Training Accuracy')
plt.plot(epochs_range, val_acc, label='Validation Accuracy')
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.title('Training and Validation Accuracy')

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
plt.plot(epochs_range, loss, label='Training Loss')
plt.plot(epochs_range, val_loss, label='Validation Loss')
plt.legend(loc='upper right')
plt.title('Training and Validation Loss')
plt.show()
```
